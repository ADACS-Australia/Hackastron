# Hackastron
This event is a unique opportunity to explore astronomy data and solve problems directly from astronomers across Australia. 
Participants will also have the opportunity to win a grand prize of $2,000 if they successfully solve one of the challenges and are then judged to have produced the over-all best solution across all challenges.

Where applicable challenge specific data and information is made available within this repository and/or on the Nimbus VMs and other 
remote services throughout this hackathon.

## Downloading specific folders
If you want to download a specific folder (e.g. De-noising of spectra) instead of cloning the entire repository you can use svn to 
checkout a subdirectory of this repository by running the following command in your shell:

**Note**: you can simply copy the url of the folder and replace `tree/master` with `trunk` to get the correct link
